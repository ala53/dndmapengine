# dndmapengine
This is a personal project for a map render for a dungeons and dragons game I am running. It is an electron app designed to run on linux, integrated with an infrared touchscreen overlay and a TV.
The purpose of the project was to provide a complete renderer, including grid lines, fog of war, and effects. It uses the touch screen to track user placed tokens and uncover fog of war or map areas based on that.

You can see a demonstration of how the project works here: https://photos.app.goo.gl/TNg6ZDEorBJ7k2hc7
